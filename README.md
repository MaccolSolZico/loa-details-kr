# Credits

This repository is a clone of the [original interface](https://github.com/karaeren/loa-details) from [@karaeren](https://github.com/karaeren).
It has been modified to work as a standalone program, without the need of any 3rd party logger.

The packet sniffing part has been made from scratch by [@Herysia](https://github.com/Herysia) and [@Mathicha](https://github.com/Mathicha), however, we can't help but thank [@Shalzuth](https://github.com/Shalzuth) for his work on [LostArkLogger](https://github.com/shalzuth/LostArkLogger).
